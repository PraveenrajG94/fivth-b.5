1. what is a cluster:

             In a computer system, a cluster is a group of servers and other resources that act like a single system and
 enable high availability and, in some cases, load balancing and parallel processing
In personal computer storage technology, a cluster is the logical unit of file storage on a hard disk;
it's managed by the computer's operating system. Any file stored on a hard disk takes up one or more clusters of storage.
A file's clusters can be scattered among different locations on the hard disk. The clusters associated with a file are kept track
of in the hard disk's file allocation table (FAT). When you read a file, the entire file is obtained for you and you aren't aware
of the clusters it is stored in. In some products, a cluster is a group of terminals or workstations attached to a common control unit.
 Merits-
* Clustering servers is completely a scalable solution. You can add resources to the cluster afterwards.
*If a server in the cluster needs any maintenance, you can do it by stopping it while handing the load over to other servers.
*Among high availability options, clustering takes a special place since it is reliable and easy to configure. In case of a server 
is having a problem providing the services furthermore, other servers in the cluster can take the load.
 Demerits-
*Cost is high. Since the cluster needs good hardware and a design, it will be costly comparing to a non-clustered server management design. Being not cost effective is a main disadvantage of this particular design.
*Since clustering needs more servers and hardware to establish one, monitoring and maintenance is hard. Thus increase the infrastructure.

what is a hadoop cluster:
            A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of 
unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications.
They also are highly scalable: If a cluster's processing power is overwhelmed by growing volumes of data,
additional cluster nodes can be added to increase throughput. Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because each piece
of data is copied onto other cluster nodes, which ensures that the data is not lost if one node fails.
Over the last few years, big data analytics has become all the rage. Even so, many organizations are discovering...
That their existing mining and analysis techniques simply are not up to the task of handling big data. One possible solution to this
problem is to build Hadoop clusters, but they are not suitable for every situation. Let's examine some of the pros and cons of using 
Hadoop clusters.
A Hadoop cluster is a special type of cluster that is specifically designed for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data.
A Hadoop cluster is essentially a computational cluster that distributes the data analysis workload across multiple cluster nodes that work
to process the data in parallel.
 Merits-
  *Distribute data and computation.The computation local to data prevents the network overload.
  *Linear scaling in the ideal case.It used to design for cheap, commodity hardware
  *Simple programming model.The end-user programmer only writes map-reduce tasks.
  *Flat scalability
2.What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster

A Node is simply a computer. This is typically non-enterprise, commodity hardware for nodes that contain data. Storage of Nodes is
called as rack. A rack is a collection of 30 or 40 nodes that are physically stored close together and are all connected to the same 
network switch. Network bandwidth between any two nodes in rack is greater than bandwidth between two nodes on different racks.
A Hadoop Cluster is a collection of racks.
 components:
The distributed filesystem component, the main example of which is the Hadoop Distributed File System, though other file systems, such as IBM GPFS-FPO, are supported. The MapReduce component, which is a framework for performing calculations on the data in the distributed file system. Pre-Hadoop 2.2 MapReduce is referred to as MapReduce V1 and has its own built-in resource manager and schedule.
This article covers the Hadoop Distributed File System and MapReduce. Let's now examine the Hadoop distributed file system - HDFS HDFS
runs on top of the existing file systems on each node in a Hadoop cluster. It is not POSIX compliant. It is designed to tolerate high
component failure rate through replication of the data.
 Arrangements;
 
 The NameNode acts as the address book for Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) because it knows not only which blocks make up 
 individual files but also where each of these blocks and their replicas are stored. When a user stores a file in HDFS, the file is 
 divided into data blocks, and three copies of these data blocks are stored in slave nodes throughout the Hadoop cluster.
 That’s a lot of data blocks to keep track of. As you might expect, knowing where the bodies are buried makes the NameNode a critically 
 important component in a Hadoop cluster. If the NameNode is unavailable, applications cannot access any data stored in HDFS you can see 
 the NameNode daemon running on a master node server. All mapping information dealing with the data blocks and their corresponding files is stored in a file named.
 HDFS is a journaling file system, which means that any data changes are logged in an edit journal that tracks events since the last 
 checkpoint — the last time when the edit log was merged with. In HDFS, the edit journal is maintained in a file named that’s stored on
 the NameNode.
